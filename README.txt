SIARD Suite - Programs for reading and writing files in the SIARD Format 2.1
============================================================================

This package contains interactive and command-line programs for reading 
and writing files in the SIARD Format 2.1

doc/manual/user/index.html contains the manual for using the binaries.
doc/manual/developer/index.html is the manual for developers wishing
build the binaries or work on the code.  

For building the binaries, Java JDK (1.7 or 1.8), Ant, and Git must 
have been installed. A copy of build.properties.template must be called 
build.properties. In it using a text editor the local values must be 
entered as directed by the comments.

More information about the build process can be found in
doc/manual/developer/build.html.

The project can be opened in Eclipse. But use of Eclipse is optional.
